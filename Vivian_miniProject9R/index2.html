    <h2>Back to December</h2>
    <p class="lyric2">I'm so glad you made time to see me </p>
    <p class="lyric2">How's life? Tell me how's your family </p>
    <p class="lyric2">I haven't seen them in a while </p>
    <p class="lyric2">You've been good, busier than ever </p>
    <p class="lyric2">Small talk, work and the weather  </p>
    <p class="lyric2">Your guard is up and I know why  </p>
    <p class="lyric2">Because the last time you saw me  </p>
    <p class="lyric2">is still burned in the back of your mind  </p>
    <p class="lyric2">You gave me roses and I left them there to die  </p>
    <p class="lyric2">So this is me swallowing my pride standing in  </p>
    <p class="lyric2">front of you saying I'm sorry for that night  </p>
    <p class="lyric2">And I go back to December all the time  </p>
    <p class="lyric2">It turns out freedom ain't nothin but missin you  </p>
    <p class="lyric2">Wishin I'd realized what I had when you were mine  </p>
    <p class="lyric2">I go back to December turn around and make it all right  </p>
    <p class="lyric2">I go back to December all the time  </p>
    <p class="lyric2">These days I haven't been sleepin  </p>
    <p class="lyric2">Stayin up playing back myself leavin  </p>
    <p class="lyric2">When your birthday passed and I didn't call  </p>
    <p class="lyric2">Then I think about summer all the beautiful times  </p>
    <p class="lyric2">I watched you laughin from the passenger side  </p>
    <p class="lyric2">And realized I loved you in the fall  </p>
    <p class="lyric2">And then the cold came the dark days  </p>
    <p class="lyric2">when fear crept into my mind​  </p>
    <p class="lyric2">you gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye​
   </p>
